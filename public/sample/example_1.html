                <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                    In the history of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the emergence of Machine Learning was a revolutionary turning point. Machine Learning is a field of technology that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Unlike traditional programming, where developers had to write every rule in code, machine learning systems analyze large-scale data to identify patterns and build their own models to make predictions or decisions. This approach has been effectively applied to various problems that require finding regularities in complex and vast data, such as spam filtering, product recommendation systems, and medical image analysis. With the development of various learning paradigms like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, machine learning has become an essential technology across a wide range of industries, not limited to specific tasks. In modern society, where data is an asset, it has become a key factor for companies and research institutions to secure a competitive edge.

                <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                    Deep Learning, a subfield of machine learning, is based on Artificial Neural Networks, which mimic the connection structure of neurons in the human brain. It excels at learning more complex and abstract features of data by using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with multiple hidden layers. Deep learning has achieved remarkable results in analyzing unstructured data like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing, which were difficult to handle with traditional machine learning techniques. For example, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dramatically improved object detection accuracy by effectively extracting spatial features from images, while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) specialized in processing sequential data like time series or sentences, contributing significantly to machine translation and chatbot development. The advancement of deep learning has been accelerated by the availability of large datasets and high-performance computing resources like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and it is now considered a core driver of future technologies that will change human life, such as autonomous vehicles and new drug development.
